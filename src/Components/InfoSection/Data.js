These property taxes are used to fund education, transportation, emergency services, parks, libraries, and more! With your help, we can make sure that you and your community are paying the fair amount of property taxes according to a fair estimate of your houseâ€™s valuation. The reason property taxes are so important for your local government and your community is due to the fact that 30% of the local governments revenue is directly from property taxes!

    description: 'This website was inspired and prototyped by students from Illinois Institute of Technology. The five students who worked on this website were operating within the confines of a semester long Inter Professional Project or IPRO. These students are of various majors and backgrounds, with the majority of them being computer science majors. This website was proposed as a solution to an existing problem in the datasets of the Cook County Assessors Office. Again, with your help, we hope that this website can be an asset to the community in order to help the CCAO with more accurate property valuations.',
